Changed:

* on tickets, can no longer do $client->tickets(["organization_id" -> 1231])->findAll(), etc. (also user_id)
* separate findMany method
* change interface of find to just take ID, then params
* added updateMany method, support both ways of updating
* change update so that it takes ID as first param
